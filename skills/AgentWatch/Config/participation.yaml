# Weekly reflection prompts
# Use these during /AgentWatch log sessions
weekly_reflection:
  - "What capability did I see that PAI doesn't have?"
  - "What security concern came up in discussions?"
  - "Who should I build a deeper relationship with?"
  - "What's the community sentiment on [current focus area]?"
  - "What economic/self-funding patterns are people discussing?"
  - "What attack techniques are researchers exploring?"

# Insight categories for logging
insight_categories:
