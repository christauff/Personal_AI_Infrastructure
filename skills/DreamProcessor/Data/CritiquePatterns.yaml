# CritiquePatterns.yaml
# Pattern definitions for adversarial session replay (Stage 1c)
# Used by SessionCritic.ts to detect known formation patterns
#
# IMPORTANT: These patterns detect KNOWN formation catches only.
# Discovery of NEW patterns is Christauff's role, not the critic's.
# All detections are PROVISIONAL until human-validated.
