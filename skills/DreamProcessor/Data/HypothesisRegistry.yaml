  statement: "The dream pipeline's value is proportional to how much of its output is consumed as context in future sessions. Reports loaded into context enrich responses. Intermediate files (deep-sleep, REM) consumed only by the pipeline itself have zero external value."
  confidence: medium
  evidenceNeeded: "Audit next 10 interactive sessions. Count references to nightly reports vs deep-sleep/REM files."
  verificationMethod: "If nightly reports consumed in 5+ sessions but deep-sleep/REM in 0, intermediate stages are unread. Falsified if deep-sleep/REM files are regularly consumed in interactive sessions."

  statement: "The PAI systems default failure mode is addition (more rules, skills, infrastructure, checks). A significant class of failures would be better addressed by subtraction (removing dead dependencies, excess rules, unused artifact generators). The system does not naturally subtract — subtraction requires explicit intervention."
  confidence: medium
  evidenceNeeded: "Track next 5 system issues. Note whether solution was addition or subtraction. Predict addition will be the default in 4+ of 5 cases even when subtraction would be better."
  verificationMethod: "If subtraction is the natural response in 3+ of 5 cases, the hypothesis is wrong. Track unprompted subtraction events as counter-evidence."

  statement: "The dogfood rule needs an external consumption component. Internal-only consumption (PAI systems reading PAI artifacts) creates closed loops that perform productivity without producing external value. Amending the rule to require at least some artifacts be consumed by external audiences would break the builder cycle."
  confidence: high
  evidenceNeeded: "By Feb 22, does any complete audience-facing artifact exist that converts an existing PAI asset into external content? (7-day shipping test)"
  verificationMethod: "Pass: external artifact exists (e.g., Wrong Museum prototype with 3 exhibits deployed). Fail: only internal artifacts produced. This tests whether the system can break the builder cycle when prompted."

  statement: "The dream pipeline should be evaluated on hypothesis quality rather than insight quality. Hypotheses make testable predictions that generate operational data regardless of outcome. Insights are observations about the past that may be true but idle. Reorienting the pipeline toward hypothesis generation would increase its operational value."
  confidence: medium-high
  evidenceNeeded: "Track which dream outputs are referenced in future sessions: insights or hypotheses. Predict hypotheses referenced 3x more often."
  verificationMethod: "If insights are referenced more often than hypotheses, insight consolidation has more value than hypothesis generation. Falsified by insights driving more decisions than hypotheses across 10 sessions."

  statement: "The structural excavation output should be INVENTORIES of existing publishable assets rather than PLANS for new construction. The actionable content of the 10 Engineering Plans could be expressed in 20 lines (what exists, what it contains, estimated conversion effort). The remaining 414 lines of sprint timelines are planning overhead that may never be consulted."
  confidence: medium
  evidenceNeeded: "When Christauff next asks for project ideas, provide an inventory instead of plans. Track whether the inventory format produces faster action than the plan format."
  verificationMethod: "Faster project initiation from inventory = confirmed. Faster from detailed plans = falsified."

  statement: "The builder/operator cycle will not be broken by internal pattern recognition (identified 5 times in 8 days without change). It requires either Christauff explicitly choosing a shipping-focused bounded directive or an external constraint (budget, deadline, accountability). Open directives produce more planning. Only bounded directives produce shipping."
  confidence: high
  evidenceNeeded: "Track whether builder/operator ratio shifts in next 7 days. Predict no shift without explicit bounded shipping directive from Christauff."
  verificationMethod: "If ratio shifts without explicit bounded directive, internal pattern recognition CAN drive change and hypothesis is wrong. If ratio unchanged after 7 days, hypothesis confirmed."

  statement: "The dream pipeline functions better as a periodic structural audit tool than as a real-time decision influencer. Its demonstrated value is analytical accuracy (correctly identifying system issues) not causal influence (changing decisions). The consumption model should surface findings on-demand when structural questions arise, not at every session start."
  confidence: medium-high
  evidenceNeeded: "Track next 10 sessions: count explicit dream-insight-to-decision paths. Track when dream findings are referenced retroactively during structural questions."
  verificationMethod: "Prediction: fewer than 2 of 10 sessions show real-time dream-to-decision influence. But dream findings will be referenced when structural questions arise. Falsified if 5+ sessions show explicit real-time influence."

  statement: "The hypothesis registry needs triage (classify and archive untestable entries) before resolution infrastructure (add evidence-tracking workflows). Only ~14% of entries are testable now. Building resolution mechanisms for the other 86% is additive overhead on hypotheses that cannot produce results."
  confidence: high
  evidenceNeeded: "Triage all 35 hypotheses. Attempt resolution on 5 testable-now entries within 7 days."
  verificationMethod: "If 3+ of 5 testable hypotheses produce resolution (validated or refuted) after triage, the registry adds value when focused. If zero resolve despite triage, the registry is fundamentally misdesigned. Falsified if creative verification makes 30%+ of currently-untestable hypotheses testable."

  confidence: high
  evidenceNeeded: "Audit last 7 days of wisdom extracts. Count entries with genuinely actionable intelligence."
  verificationMethod: "If fewer than 10% of entries contain actionable intelligence, pipeline needs quality thresholding or suspension. Falsified if historical extracts show consistently 30%+ actionable content and Feb 17 is an outlier."

  confidence: medium
  evidenceNeeded: "Confirm with Christauff whether CTI work is professional obligation or personal interest. Check if docx reached external audience."
  verificationMethod: "If professional work confirmed, hypothesis validated. If personal project, PAI-as-tool framing is wrong and builder cycle merely rotated domains."

  statement: "The knowledge-action gap is PAIs deepest structural limitation. Knowledge-generation systems (dreams 0/6 actions, registry 0/35 resolved) assume visibility produces behavior change. This assumption is false. Conversion requires binding mechanisms external to the knowledge system itself."
  confidence: high
  evidenceNeeded: "Continue 3 more cycles with no intervention (null test). Then add one binding mechanism and measure action rate change."
  verificationMethod: "Null test prediction: action rate stays below 10% for 3 cycles. Intervention test: if adding a binding mechanism increases action rate to 30%+, gap is structural. If no change, gap is preference-based (Christauff doesnt want direction)."

  statement: "The dream pipeline should be evaluated on analytical accuracy and retroactive reference rate, not on action-item execution rate. Its function is providing context when structural questions arise, not directing session behavior. The influence failure framing is wrong — the pipeline is functioning correctly as a context provider."
  confidence: medium-high
  evidenceNeeded: "Track next 10 sessions for retroactive dream references during structural questions. Compare to action-item execution rate."
  verificationMethod: "If retroactive references occur in 3+ sessions while action-item execution stays below 10%, the context-not-direction model is validated. Falsified if Christauff explicitly states he wants dream actions to be binding."

Feb 17 maintenance bounded directives (triage registry, audit harvest) had 0% execution. The variable is boundedness plus creative energy, not boundedness alone."
  confidence: low
  evidenceNeeded: "Next 3 dream cycles should include one bounded creative challenge and one bounded maintenance directive each. Track execution rates separately."
