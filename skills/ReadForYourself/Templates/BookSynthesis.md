## RedTeam Check: Training Data Pollution

### Conclusions That Might Be Training-Derived

⚠️ **Flagged by adversarial analysis:**

1. [Conclusion] - *Why it might be training data:* [Reason]
2. [Conclusion] - *Why it might be training data:* [Reason]

### Verified as Direct Observation

✅ **Confirmed from text:**

1. [Conclusion] - *Text evidence:* [Quote/location]
2. [Conclusion] - *Text evidence:* [Quote/location]

### Resolution

For each flagged item, either:
- Traced to specific text quote → Verified ✅
- Cannot find text support → Acknowledged as potentially training-derived ⚠️
- Removed from conclusions → Deleted ❌

## Consilience Assessment

Does this reading converge with other independent sources?

| Source | Era | Methodology | Convergent Point |
|--------|-----|-------------|------------------|
| [Source 1] | [Era] | [How they approached it] | [What converges] |
| [Source 2] | [Era] | [How they approached it] | [What converges] |

### Convergence Strength

- **Strong convergence:** [What multiple independent sources agree on]
- **Partial convergence:** [Where there's some alignment]
- **Divergence:** [Where sources disagree - requires more investigation]

### Epistemic Confidence

Based on consilience analysis:
- **High confidence:** [Claims with strong convergence]
- **Medium confidence:** [Claims with partial support]
- **Low confidence / Uncertain:** [Claims needing more sources]
