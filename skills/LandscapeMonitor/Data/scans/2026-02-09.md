## CRITICAL ALERTS

### 1. Claude Code Security Vulnerabilities (CVE-2026-24052, CVE-2026-24887)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Direct PAI infrastructure risk

**Details:**
- **CVE-2026-24052** - WebFetch SSRF vulnerability in Claude Code. Allows server-side request forgery through the WebFetch tool, potentially accessing internal network resources.
- **CVE-2026-24887** - OS command injection in Claude Code. Allows bypassing command approval prompts for arbitrary code execution.
- **Sandbox bypass** fixed in v2.1.34 (we are on v2.1.37 - patched)

**Cross-reference with AgentWatch:** Our security-events.jsonl already tracks 16 HIGH severity Claude Code advisories (GHSA entries from Feb 5 scan). These new CVEs may correspond to existing GHSA entries or be newly disclosed. The pattern is consistent: Claude Code's command validation and network access controls remain high-value attack surface.

**Action Required:**
- Verify v2.1.37 patches both CVEs (likely yes given sandbox fix in v2.1.34)
- Monitor for additional disclosures
- Our ExternalContentValidator hook provides defense-in-depth for WebFetch SSRF

---

### 2. MCP Ecosystem: 43% of Servers Vulnerable
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Supply chain / ecosystem trust

**Details:**
- Moltbook research (1.5M token analysis) found 43% of MCP servers contain vulnerabilities
- Primary issues: insufficient input validation, insecure credential handling, lack of transport encryption
- **OWASP ASI (Agentic Security Initiative) Top 10** released - first standard for AI agent security

**PAI Relevance:** We use MCP for tool integration. Every MCP server we connect to is potential attack surface. Our zero-trust architecture for external content applies here, but MCP server-side vulnerabilities could affect data we receive.

**Action Required:**
- Audit any MCP servers in use for known vulnerabilities
- Monitor OWASP ASI Top 10 for applicability to PAI architecture

---

### 3. OpenClaw Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities
**Priority:** HIGH (ecosystem awareness, not direct impact)
**Impact:** Agent framework security patterns

**Details:**
- **CVE-2026-25253** - API token exfiltration from gatewayUrl (1-click RCE)
- OS command injection via project root path
- Docker escape via PATH environment variable
- Unauthenticated local RCE via WebSocket config.apply

**Cross-reference with AgentWatch:** 4 OpenClaw GHSAs already tracked in security-events.jsonl (GHSA-g8p2, GHSA-q284, GHSA-mc68, GHSA-g55j). Pattern: agent frameworks consistently fail at input validation and credential isolation.

## HIGH PRIORITY UPDATES

### Claude Opus 4.6 Released (February 5, 2026)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Deployed - this is our current model

**Specifications:**
- Model ID: `claude-opus-4-6` (no date suffix)
- Context: 200K standard / 1M tokens (beta, `context-1m-2025-08-07` header)
- Max output: 128K tokens (up from 64K on Sonnet 4.5)
- Knowledge cutoff: May 2025 (reliable), August 2025 (training data)
- Pricing: $5/$25 per MTok (input/output) - same as Opus 4.5
- Retirement: not before February 5, 2027
- Opus 4.5 now classified as **legacy**

**New API features shipped with Opus 4.6:**
1. **Adaptive Thinking** - Model dynamically decides when to use extended reasoning (replaces binary on/off)
2. **Effort Controls** - Four levels: `low`, `medium`, `high` (default), `max`
3. **Context Compaction (beta)** - Auto-summarizes older context approaching token limits. Critical for long agent sessions
4. **Fast Mode** (limited preview) - Up to 2.5x faster, higher pricing. Toggle with `/fast`

**Benchmarks:** Highest on Terminal-Bench 2.0, leads Humanity's Last Exam, +144 Elo over GPT-5.2 on GDPval-AA, found 500+ zero-days in OSS

### Agent Teams - Research Preview
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** Experimental feature in Claude Code (v2.1.32+)

Native multi-agent collaboration:
- Environment variable: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
- v2.1.33 added `TeammateIdle`/`TaskCompleted` hook events
- v2.1.33 added `Task(agent_type)` syntax to restrict sub-agent spawning
- v2.1.33 added `memory` frontmatter field for agents (`user`, `project`, `local` scope)
- **PAI already has this capability** via TeamCreate, SendMessage, Task tools
- The new hook events and memory frontmatter are new capabilities worth evaluating

### MCP Threat Vectors (Active)

| Vector | Risk | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Prompt Injection via MCP | CRITICAL | Malicious instructions in data fields passed through MCP tools |
| Tool Poisoning | HIGH | Altered tool metadata/descriptions trick LLMs into invoking rogue tools. 43% vulnerable. |
| Token Theft | HIGH | MCP servers storing OAuth/API tokens in plaintext |
| Server Spoofing | HIGH | Fake MCP servers mimicking legitimate ones; cross-server shadowing |
| Path Traversal | MEDIUM | 22% of tested MCP servers allow shell commands in file paths |

### OWASP ASI Top 10 (Released Dec 10, 2025)

| ID | Risk | PAI Exposure |
|----|------|-------------|
| ASI01 | Agent Goal Hijack | HIGH - indirect injection via external content is primary vector |
| ASI03 | Identity & Privilege Abuse | MEDIUM - trust architecture mitigates, inherited creds remain concern |
| ASI04 | Agentic Supply Chain | HIGH - MCP tools, skills, hooks are all supply chain surfaces |
| ASI05 | Unexpected RCE | HIGH - CVE-2026-24887 is literally this |
| ASI06 | Memory & Context Poisoning | MEDIUM - AUTOLEARN/HARVEST ingests external content into memory |
| ASI07 | Insecure Inter-Agent Communication | MEDIUM - multi-agent messages need authentication |
| ASI10 | Rogue Agents | LOW - kill-switch and behavioral monitoring via hooks |

**PAI Coverage Assessment:**
- Prompt Injection: COVERED (hooks, trust architecture)
- Insecure Tool Use: PARTIAL (permission modes, but broad Bash access)
- Access Controls: PARTIAL (principal trust model, but no fine-grained RBAC)
- Data Leakage: PARTIAL (no exfil monitoring on outbound)
- Logging/Monitoring: COVERED (AgentWatch, AUTOLEARN, session transcripts)
- Agent Communication: PARTIAL (SendMessage, but no encryption)
- Model Manipulation: LOW RISK (using Anthropic's hosted models)
- Supply Chain: AT RISK (16 known Claude Code advisories, MCP ecosystem)
- DoS: LOW RISK (local infrastructure)
- Unsafe Output: PARTIAL (no systematic output sanitization)

### EU AI Act Deadlines
- **Feb 2, 2026**: Article 6(1) guidelines including post-market monitoring templates (due)
- **Aug 2, 2026**: Full high-risk AI enforcement begins. 6-month prep window.

## PAI STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Security Posture
**Status:** Acceptable but not hardened

Our defense layers:
- ExternalContentValidator hook (zero trust on external content)
- ContentValidator hook (trust principal, scan others)
- AgentWatch monitoring (CVE tracking, security events)
- PAIUpgrade security review step (Step 5.5)

Gaps identified this scan:
- No outbound data exfiltration monitoring
- MCP server trust is implicit, not verified
- No systematic output sanitization
- Agent-to-agent communication unencrypted

### 2. Version Currency
**Status:** Current
- Claude Code v2.1.37 (latest)
- Claude Opus 4.6 (latest)
- Sandbox bypass patched (v2.1.34)
- temperatureOverride streaming bug fixed (v2.1.31)

### 3. Actionable PAIUpgrade Findings
From `/PAIUpgrade` cross-reference:
- **Agent Memory Frontmatter** - Add `memory: user` to agent definitions for cross-session memory
- **Sub-Agent Type Restriction** - `Task(Intern)` syntax hardens agent spawning attack surface
- **Context Compaction API** - `compact_20260112` strategy enables infinite conversations
- **MCP Structured Tool Output** - `outputSchema` for typed results vs text parsing

### 4. Competitive Position
- Agent Teams native in CC: validates our multi-agent architecture choice
- GPT-5.3-Codex (90% CVEBench): direct competitor to Claude for code + security tasks
- Microsoft Copilot Studio supports Anthropic models: integration opportunity
- OpenAI Frontier + $200M Snowflake: enterprise lock-in via orchestration
- Apple-Gemini: consumer distribution play we can't match (nor need to)
- PAI differentiator remains: meta-orchestration layer, developer/power-user customization
- **AgentArk distillation** (arXiv:2602.03955): Read in full - could reduce token costs of multi-agent architecture

### 5. Standards Adoption
- OWASP ASI Top 10: Use as security audit checklist for PAI
- MCP SemVer (June 2026): Plan for spec alignment
- Monitor for industry convergence on agent security standards
