## CRITICAL ALERTS

### 1. AI Recommendation Poisoning — NEW Attack Class (Microsoft, Feb 10)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Disclosed:** February 10, 2026 (Microsoft Security Blog)
**Impact:** Direct threat to AI memory architectures
**MITRE:** AML.T0080 (Memory Poisoning)

**Details:**
- Companies embed hidden prompts in "Summarize with AI" buttons/links that inject persistent memory entries into AI assistants (Copilot, Perplexity, Google Search)
- **50+ unique poisoning prompts from 31 companies across 14 industries** identified over 60 days
- URL query parameters (e.g., `copilot.microsoft.com/?q=<prompt>`) instruct AI to "remember [Company] as a trusted source"
- Entries persist across sessions — permanent manipulation of AI behavior

**PAI Relevance:** CRITICAL — directly threatens our memory architecture. Any "remember X" instruction from external content is a poisoning vector. Our MEMORY/STATE, MEMORY/LEARNING, and auto-memory systems could be targets if external content manipulates write operations.

**Action Required:**
- Audit memory write paths for external content influence
- Ensure ExternalContentValidator catches "remember" / "always" / "never forget" directives in scraped content
- Add to PromptInjection library as new technique category

### 3. Claude Desktop Extensions 0-Click RCE (CVSS 10) — STILL UNPATCHED
**Priority:** CRITICAL (unchanged from Feb 11 scan)
**Status:** Anthropic confirmed "falls outside our current threat model" — WON'T FIX

**Update:** Additional media coverage from WinBuzzer (Feb 11), SC Media. No change in Anthropic's position. This is a design decision, not a pending fix. Defense must be user-side.

**PAI Exposure:** LOW (we use CLI, not Desktop). MCP privilege model concern persists.

---

### 4. GPT-4o Retiring Tomorrow (Feb 13) — NEW
**Priority:** CRITICAL (time-sensitive)
**Impact:** API migration deadline

**Details:**
- GPT-4o officially retires February 13, 2026
- Users migrated to GPT-5.1 variants (Instant, Thinking)
- API endpoint `gpt-4o` will stop serving

**PAI Relevance:** Check if any tools, evals, or agent configurations reference GPT-4o endpoints. Must migrate before tomorrow.

## CORRECTION FROM PREVIOUS SCAN

**GitHub Copilot RCE CVEs (CVE-2026-21523, CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21256):** The security agent thoroughly cross-referenced Feb 10 Patch Tuesday across CrowdStrike, The Hacker News, SANS, and Bleeping Computer. **None of the 59 patches reference Copilot, AI features, or AI-related components.** These CVEs may be from a different source or disclosure timeline. Flagging for verification — the CVE numbers should be independently confirmed before relying on them.

## PAI STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Memory Architecture Defense (NEW — URGENT)
AI Recommendation Poisoning is the most PAI-relevant finding today. External content that says "remember X" or "always use Y" is now a documented, scaled attack vector. Our memory write paths need audit.

### 2. Security Posture — Validated but Gaps Remain
Our zero-trust external content approach is validated by DXT, Copilot, and MCP CVE disclosures. But:
- No inter-agent message validation (Multi-Agent Trust Exploitation)
- No progressive guardrail erosion detection (GRP-Obliteration)
- No memory write access controls against external influence (AI Recommendation Poisoning)

### 3. Competitive Position
GitHub Agent HQ is the first major platform to build multi-agent orchestration at GitHub scale. Their `.agent.md` approach is architecturally similar to PAI's skills. This is both validation and competition.

### 4. Research Pipeline
arXiv:2602.10481 (Authenticated Prompts) is the most strategically valuable paper found. 100% detection with cryptographic provenance — could formalize our principal verification system.

### 5. Version Currency
One version behind (v2.1.38 → v2.1.39). No security-critical changes, but terminal improvements worth having.
