# Trigger Tests: RedTeam

## Should Trigger
1. "red team this microservices migration proposal" - "red team" is a direct trigger; routes to ParallelAnalysis workflow for stress-testing the proposal
2. "poke holes in my plan to raise Series A at a $50M valuation" - Adversarial critique of a plan/argument routes to ParallelAnalysis for steelman + counter-argument
3. "give me the strongest counterarguments against this architecture" - "counterarguments" is a direct trigger; the skill produces devastating counter-arguments
4. "stress test this business strategy before we present to the board" - "stress test" is a direct trigger; 32 agents analyze from multiple expert perspectives
5. "battle of bots - which approach is better for our caching layer?" - Adversarial validation between competing approaches routes to AdversarialValidation workflow

## Should NOT Trigger
1. "test this chatbot for prompt injection vulnerabilities" - Correct skill: PromptInjection (technical AI security testing, not adversarial analysis of ideas/arguments)
2. "do a penetration test on our web application" - Correct skill: WebAssessment (web security testing, not intellectual adversarial analysis)
3. "think deeply about this complex architecture problem" - Correct skill: BeCreative (extended thinking/deep reasoning, not adversarial critique)
4. "break down this problem to its fundamental components" - Correct skill: FirstPrinciples (first principles decomposition, not adversarial attack on an argument)
5. "research the pros and cons of Kubernetes vs serverless" - Correct skill: Research (general comparative research, not adversarial stress-testing of a specific position)
