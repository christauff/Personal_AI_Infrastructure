# MorningBrief Skill

**Created:** 2026-01-30
**Purpose:** Synthesize overnight work into actionable morning briefing
**Part of:** The Accelerando System

---

## Overview

Every morning should start with Aineko presenting what accumulated overnight.
This skill reads tide pool outputs, dream reports, and landscape alerts to
deliver a concise briefing.

**Philosophy:** The Accelerando cat revealed knowledge when the time was right.
MorningBrief is that moment - the daily reconnection where accumulated insights
become visible.

---

## Voice Notification

**MANDATORY - Execute immediately:**

```bash
curl -s --connect-timeout 3 --max-time 5 -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Preparing your morning briefing from overnight accumulation"}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

---

## Triggers

This skill activates on:
- "good morning"
- "morning brief"
- "what happened overnight"
- "overnight summary"
- "morning report"

---

## Workflow

### Single Workflow: `Workflows/Brief.md`

1. **Read overnight outputs**
   - `POOLS/COMPLETE/*.md` - Tide pool results
   - `DREAMS/NIGHTLY/{today}.md` - Dream report
   - `skills/LandscapeMonitor/Data/alerts/` - Flagged items

2. **Prioritize content**
   - Critical alerts first
   - High-value tide pool outputs
   - Dream connections worth noting
   - Digest of remaining items

3. **Generate briefing**
   - Executive summary (30 seconds to read)
   - Detailed sections (if user wants more)
   - Action recommendations

4. **Offer drill-down**
   - "Want me to expand on any of these?"
   - "Should I investigate the MCP change further?"

---

## Briefing Format

```markdown
Good morning, Christauff.

## Overnight Synthesis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### Alerts
{critical/high items that need attention}

### Tide Pools Completed
{summary of background research/work}

### Dream Connections
{interesting patterns from memory consolidation}

### Landscape Updates
{notable changes in the agent ecosystem}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Files staged:** {count} in POOLS/COMPLETE/
**Dream report:** DREAMS/NIGHTLY/{date}.md

Shall I expand on any of these?
```

## Verbosity Levels

**Quick** (default): Executive summary only, <30 seconds to read
**Standard**: Summary + key details, ~2 minutes to read
**Full**: Everything, with file contents, ~5 minutes

User can specify:
- "quick morning brief"
- "full overnight report"
- "just the alerts"

---

## Post-Brief Actions

After delivering the brief, offer:

1. **Drill-down**: "Tell me more about X"
2. **Action**: "Research that MCP change"
3. **Dismiss**: "Thanks, that's all"
4. **Archive**: "Archive the low-priority items"

---

## Integration Points

### Overnight Processor
The processor stages all content that MorningBrief reads.
Brief quality depends on overnight processing completing.

### Tide Pools
Brief summarizes and prioritizes pool outputs.
Can spawn new pools based on morning discussion.

### Dream Journal
Brief highlights unexpected connections.
Surfaces synthesis candidates for review.

### LandscapeMonitor
Brief leads with alerts.
Offers deep-dive on flagged items.

## Example Session

```
User: good morning

Aineko: Good morning, Christauff.

## Overnight Synthesis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### Alerts
- **MCP 2.1 Released** - Breaking change in tool schemas (Anthropic blog)
  └─ May affect PAI's MCP integration plan

### Tide Pools Completed
- **Research: EU AI Act classification** - Summary ready
  └─ Key finding: Personal use likely exempt from high-risk classification
- **Synthesis: Yesterday's strategy session** - Decisions captured

### Dream Connections
- Pattern noticed: "local-first" theme appears in 7 files across 3 months
  └─ This has been a consistent strategic direction since November

### Landscape Updates
- CrewAI v0.9 released with improved memory
- New paper on multi-agent orchestration (arXiv)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Files staged:** 3 in POOLS/COMPLETE/
**Dream report:** DREAMS/NIGHTLY/2026-01-31.md

Shall I expand on any of these?

User: Tell me more about the MCP change

Aineko: [Invokes LandscapeMonitor/DeepDive or reads the alert detail]
```
